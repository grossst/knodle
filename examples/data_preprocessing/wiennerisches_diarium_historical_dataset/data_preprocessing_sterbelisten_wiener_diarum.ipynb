    "## Wiener Diarum Sterbelisten: Data Preprocessing for Sequence Labeling\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wiener Zeitung is the oldest running newspaper in the world. It started in 1703 as Wiener Diarum and changed in 1780 to Wiener Zeitung. Through its central role in the Habsburg monarchy it distributed knowledge across all disciplines thorughout Europe. This also helped to put Vienna into a more prominent position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ACDH-CH) started a project with the goal of digitalising and providing this historically important data. The digitsed newspapers as well as current developements can be found here: \n",
    "https://digitarium.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/willkommen/\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ihb/forschungsbereiche/kunstgeschichte/forschung/habsburgische-repraesentation/das-wiennerische-diarium\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This valuable resource is useful for multiple disciplines as it holds historical data on science, politics, cultural and other sections. It is interesting for linguistic research as the normalisation of german orthography only started at the end of the 18th cenutry and was only fully set in force in the late 19th cenutry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this task there is data prepared by the research group of the ACDH-CH. The digitalised Wiener Zeitung is partially available as TEI XML as well as an extracted HTML on Github. This data set contains only a few newspapers per year starting from 1706.\n",
    "\n",
    "The link to the Github Repository of the ACDH-CH research group shows their current work porcess as well as the original data used for this Tutorial: https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/sterbelisten\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Tutorial we want to prepare the data provided by the research group of the ACDH-CH in order to apply sequence labeling to it and fit the data into the knodle frame work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to automatically fiter out place names from the obituaries. These lists are in every newspaper issue and contain several notes about the death of people. Usually they contain the name, age, reason and place of death. By filtering out the place names automatically, one can extract historical knowledge about the city of Vienna and its deveopement as well as orthographical changes and therewith historical linugistical knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this sequence labelling task we need to build the data in a way that is suitable for a weakly supervised machine learning approach. We will need to read the .html file and clean all the additional characters as illustrated later on in this tutorial. We will also tokenise the words given and translate the provided \\<mark> tags into a matrix format that provides the location of the toponym within the sentence. Our rules are the tagged place names, which are a result of the work made by the team of the ACDH-CH. We want to train a model that can detect place names by using the data we are provided with by the research group of the ACDH-CH. As this data is extremly difficult to organise due to the big spelling variation, it is our goal to try a machine learning approach rather than a rule-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What we have: provided by the research group of the ACDH-CH\n",
    "The approach of the research group of the ACDH-CH is a rule-based approach on finding place names.  By creating patterns with which they would identify place names and compare them to historical dictionaries, they gather place names in order to link them to other sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example regular expressions containing prepositons and other words that would occur in those obituaries (Sterbelisten) are used as patterns. The matched words are then extracted and sent to DTA-CAB (https://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/doku/software); another online tool that compares historically varying spelling by comparing it to historical dictionaries and using sound-distance measures like the Levenshtein distance measure. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A .html file that has \\<mark> on most toponyms but sometimes on persons and other names too.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A .xml file containing the sterbelisten.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A .csv files with Toponyms extracted from Wien Geschichte Wiki.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A .txt file containing a list with sucessfully extracted toponyms, which are already normalised into contemporary orthography by comparing the results with the Wien Geschichte Wiki(https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Wien_Geschichte_Wiki).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some notebooks and other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the ACDH-CH research group is activley working on their project, the Github repository is constantly changing and developing. For our Tutorial we will only use the .html file as it contains the marked place names we need to build our training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What we want\n",
    "###### A trainig and test set for our sequence labeling task containing three matrices:\n",
    "- T Matrix containing the classes and the rules.(panda data frame with the dimensions 2xnumber of place names).\n",
    "- Z Matrices one for each sentence each containing the words in the sentence and all our rules (=place names)(np.matrix, sparse).\n",
    "- X Matrix containing the samples (pandas data frame).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What to do\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Read in the html file**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strip of tags and clean the text with regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a list with each sentence as a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to keep the abbreviations as the expansion would already involve normalisation and we want to try to work with the 'raw' data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Read in already extracted placenames**\n",
    "- Extract all \\<mark> words from the .html file provided by the ACDH-CH research group and assign an ID.\n",
    "- Loop through all samples and create lists containing either None if the word is not a place name or the ID of the place name if the word is part of a place name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Building training data**\n",
    "\n",
    "**X Matrix**\n",
    "pandas data frame or list with all  cleaned sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**T Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "np.sparse matirx one column 0, one column 1, rows are place names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z Matrices**\n",
    "numpy.narray\n",
    "columns= keywords \n",
    "rows = words in sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Building test data** \n",
    "\n",
    "manually checked! \n",
    "There is the 'timemachine_evaluatuin_v1_edited_corrected.jsonl which should contain manually corrected place names but it is not usable for our purposes."
